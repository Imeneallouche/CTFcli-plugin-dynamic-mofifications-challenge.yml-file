<p><b>Capture The Flag</b>, as known for <b>"CTF"</b> are challenges in which <b>"flags"</b> 
are secretly hidden in purposefully-vulnerable programs or websites where it is up to the player to find them</p>

<p> these challenges are most likely organized in competitions hosted in websites where these initiaitves need many
tools such as: <a href=""> CTFd</a>, <a href=""> CTFcli</a> and most likely <a href=""> Challenge.yml</a> file for each CTF challenge.

<p>for the purpose of facilitating and improving the well going of the CTF competitions, the aim of this project is to develop a new CTFcli plugin
that dynamically changes the challenge.yml file </p>
